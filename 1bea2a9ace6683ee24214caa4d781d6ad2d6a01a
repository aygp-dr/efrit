Multi-Agent Review Context:

Four specialized agents reviewed the Efrit definition, each bringing unique perspectives:

L5 ENGINEER - Implementation Reality Check:
Found critical bug: Documentation uses 'req_' prefix but code uses 'efrit_' prefix.
This would cause immediate production failures. Also identified missing request
types and wrong function names. The implementation-focused review caught details
that high-level reviews would miss.

L6 ENGINEER - Integration Architecture:
Identified systemic risks: No API versioning, race conditions with timestamp IDs,
missing circuit breakers. Questioned file-based approach for enterprise integration.
Recognized the creative solution but highlighted scalability ceiling.

L7 ENGINEER - Strategic Architecture:
Raised fundamental question: Is this an Emacs tool or AI platform? Can't be both
effectively. Identified NIH syndrome risk and technical debt accumulation.
Recommended choosing clear strategic direction before further development.

TECHNICAL WRITER - User Experience:
Found confusing terminology (queue for non-FIFO), poor information architecture,
missing prerequisites. Documentation follows 'how we built it' pattern instead
of 'how to use it' pattern. Needs complete restructure for usability.

SYNTHESIS OF TRADE-OFFS:

1. Simplicity vs Correctness:
   - Chose: Simple file-based approach
   - Cost: Scalability and reliability limitations
   - Benefit: No infrastructure dependencies

2. Experimentation vs Production:
   - Chose: Rapid prototyping capability
   - Cost: Missing production safeguards
   - Benefit: Fast iteration cycles

3. Flexibility vs Complexity:
   - Chose: Multi-modal operation (chat/do/agent)
   - Cost: Increased cognitive load
   - Benefit: Addresses diverse use cases

4. Local vs Global Optimization:
   - Chose: Solve immediate Emacs-AI communication
   - Cost: Architecture doesn't generalize
   - Benefit: Working solution today

CRITICAL INSIGHTS:
- The 'queue' naming is actively harmful - misleads about behavior
- File-based approach is creative but hits ceiling quickly
- Security model (unlimited Elisp) is concerning
- Documentation matches mental model of builder, not user

RECOMMENDATION:
Fix critical bugs (ID format) immediately. Then decide strategic direction
before investing in either hardening current approach or redesigning.
