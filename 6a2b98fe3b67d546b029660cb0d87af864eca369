Efrit Agent Context and Clarification:

The Efrit agent definition includes YAML front matter matching the standard
format used by other Claude Code agents in ~/.claude/agents/:
- name: efrit
- description: Emacs AI assistant specializing in Elisp
- color: magenta (matching the meta-observer theme)
- emoji: ðŸ”® (crystal ball representing AI/magic theme)

Key architectural insights discovered during development:
1. efrit-remote-queue is NOT a FIFO - it's event-driven using kqueue on FreeBSD
2. Auth credentials are looked up via auth-source in this order:
   - ~/.authinfo.gpg (encrypted)
   - ~/.authinfo (plain text)
   - ~/.netrc (fallback)
3. tmux capture-pane should never be truncated for testing

The agent is specialized for:
- Elisp async patterns with url-retrieve
- Queue-based inter-agent communication
- CONTINUE framework integration
- Ollama structured output experiments

This complements the existing experiments in the repository.
