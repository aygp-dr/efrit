Context: Fixed compilation issues with efrit-agent.el unable to load efrit-tools.

Testing performed:
- Ran gmake clean, check, lint, compile successfully
- All 12 elisp files compiled without errors
- Only minor warning about efrit-agent-run in efrit-command.el
- Verified .elc files are properly gitignored

Issue encountered:
- Original relative path './lisp' failed during byte-compilation
- efrit-agent.el couldn't find efrit-tools dependency
- Solution: Added PROJECT_ROOT variable using $(shell pwd) for absolute paths

Interactive testing:
- Successfully tested efrit-do with tmux sessions
- Created 4 haiku buffers in split window layout
- Documented auth-source lookup order for Anthropic API
- Added ~/.authinfo template entry

Security notes:
- Carefully checked all commits for API keys before pushing
- Used grep to verify no sensitive data in staged files
- All experiments properly exclude credentials

Experiments created:
- 001-ollama-elisp-only: Pure Elisp responses
- 002-remote-queue-deep-dive: Discovered kqueue/filenotify usage
- 003-continue-framework-agents: Minimal agent simulation
