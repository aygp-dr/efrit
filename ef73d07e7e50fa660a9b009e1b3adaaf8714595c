Context for Experiment 001: Ollama Elisp-only

User requested an experiment to communicate with Ollama using only HTTP
to get pure Elisp responses. The goal was to have Ollama return valid
Elisp code that could be directly executed by Emacs without any parsing.

Key design decisions:
1. Structured output with JSON schema - Most reliable method to enforce format
2. Explicit system prompt rules - Prevents natural language explanations
3. Auto-discovery of coding models - Prefers qwen2.5-coder
4. Temperature set to 0.1 - Ensures deterministic responses

Use cases explored:
- File operations (directory listing, file checks)
- Data manipulation (lists, calculations)
- Buffer operations (counting, getting info)
- System information queries

This experiment shows how LLMs can be integrated as code generators
rather than conversational agents, producing machine-executable output.
