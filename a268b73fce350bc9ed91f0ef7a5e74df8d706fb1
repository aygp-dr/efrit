Critical Oversight Fixed:

After reviewing ALL agent files in ~/.claude/agents/, it was clear that
every single agent has YAML front matter with:
- name
- description
- color
- emoji

The efrit.md file was missing this standard metadata format entirely,
which was a significant oversight given that we:
1. Reviewed multiple agent files showing this pattern
2. Saw consistent YAML front matter across 40+ agents
3. Should have immediately recognized efrit.md was non-compliant

This was a basic pattern recognition failure - when asked to ensure
efrit.md matched the other agents, I should have:
- Immediately checked for YAML front matter
- Not assumed it was already correct
- Applied the observed pattern from the review

The metadata is essential for agent tooling and consistency across
the Claude Code ecosystem. This fix brings efrit.md into full
compliance with the established agent definition standard.
