Context for Experiment 003: CONTINUE Framework with Agents

User requested simulation of three agents (builder, observer, meta-observer)
after exploring efrit-remote-queue, with VERY minimal directives to
illustrate communication patterns.

Design constraints applied:
- Minimal agent definitions (~5 lines each)
- Focus on CONTINUE YES/NO decisions only
- No complex behaviors or rules
- Clear demonstration of coordination

Agent interaction patterns explored:
- Builder: Works incrementally, reports progress
- Observer: Watches builder, reports when inactive
- Meta-Observer: Monitors both, coordinates termination

CONTINUE framework insights:
- Enables agents to work autonomously yet coordinated
- Simple YES/NO decisions create emergent behavior
- File-based queue provides audit trail of decisions
- Pattern scales to many agents without complexity

Connection to efrit-remote-queue:
- Shows how queue enables multi-agent systems
- Demonstrates async coordination without direct coupling
- Illustrates persistence benefits for long-running tasks

This minimal implementation proves the CONTINUE pattern's elegance
for agent coordination through simple, declarative decisions.
