Context for Experiment 004: Ollama Tool Calling

User requested an experiment to track tool calling using Elisp primitives
after reading about Ollama's tool support announcement.

Implementation approach:
- Created JSON schemas for Elisp functions per Ollama spec
- Mapped native functions: dired, find-file, load-file, grep-find
- Built execution framework with comprehensive error handling
- Added tool call logging for audit trail

Testing considerations:
- Shell script validates Ollama installation first
- Checks for tool-supporting models before testing
- Uses curl to demonstrate raw API usage
- No credentials needed for Ollama (local inference)

This experiment bridges Ollama's tool calling with Emacs functionality,
enabling LLMs to directly manipulate the editor environment.
