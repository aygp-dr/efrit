Context for Queue Usage Examples

User requested documentation showing how agents communicate through
efrit-remote-queue, with specific examples using L5/L7 engineers
and the CONTINUE pattern.

Examples created:
- L5 (implementation) and L7 (architecture) collaboration
- Code reviewer coordinating frontend, backend, test engineers
- CONTINUE pattern with progressive enhancement
- Real JSON structures for queue communication

Design principles shown:
- Agents communicate asynchronously via JSON files
- Each agent makes independent CONTINUE decisions
- Metadata enables coordination without direct coupling
- File-based approach provides persistence and audit trail

Based on earlier experiments understanding that efrit-remote-queue
is NOT a FIFO but an event-driven, file-based message system using
filesystem notifications (kqueue on FreeBSD).
