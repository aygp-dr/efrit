Context for Experiment 005: Interactive tmux Testing

User requested documentation of how we tested Efrit interactively
using tmux sessions, with plans to record demos using asciinema.

Testing process discovered:
- tmux capture-pane -p gives full screen context (don't use head/tail)
- Send keys carefully with proper control sequences
- Use sleep for async operations
- Check Messages buffer for debugging

Security focus:
- User emphasized NEVER showing API keys or authinfo in demos
- Must be PARANOID about credentials in recordings
- Check screen after each command during demos
- Use emacs -Q to avoid loading user's init file

Demo recording plan:
- asciinema rec for terminal recording
- agg tool for converting to GIF
- Multiple safety checks before recording
- Separate demos for different features

This experiment ensures reproducible, safe demonstrations.
