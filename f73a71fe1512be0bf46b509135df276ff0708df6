Implementation Details Added:

Based on experiments/002-remote-queue-deep-dive findings:

Key clarifications made:
1. Identity section now explicitly states it's NOT a FIFO queue
2. Added that it uses filesystem notifications (kqueue/inotify)
3. Documented the event-driven nature vs polling

Implementation details section added with:
- Core mechanism explanation (filenotify-add-watch)
- Platform-specific file watching systems
- Complete flow sequence including processing directory
- Specific Elisp function names for reference

This addresses the vague 'Identity' section by providing concrete
technical details discovered during experiment 002. The agent now
has proper context about HOW the system works internally, not just
the API surface.

Critical insight: The 'queue' name is misleading - it's actually
an event-driven message passing system using filesystem notifications
for inter-process communication between AI and Emacs.
